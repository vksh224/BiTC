===========ReadLexingtonData.py

-> This file generates the route trajectories for each bus.
-> It also generates geographical coordinates for data centers and POIs.


============== computeLINKEXISTS.py

-> This file basically creates the series of graph at various times.

Currently, I store the graph as 5D-matrix.

LINK_EXISTS[i, j, s, ts, te] = 0/1

where,

i and j are node ids,
s is the band type (it would always be 0, if we only consider only one band type, say WiFi),
ts and te are start and end times for the existence of a communication link between nodes i and j
over band type s.

============= specBW.py

-> This file basically enables varying channel bandwidth at different times,
between different pair of nodes.

-> This becomes important to simulate the real scenarios,
where bandwidths vary across space and time dimensions.
